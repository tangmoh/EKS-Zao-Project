Steps:

1. Create a new EC2 Keypair
 (or)
   Use an existing keypair. But Make sure you have the pem file to connect to EC2 instance that will be created in Step2

2. Create a stack with template eks-cluster-cft.yaml and change the parameters accordingly

Parameters:

```
SSHKeyPair=<output from step1>
EnvironmentName=<<Name of environment> --> By default it is eks-cluster
```

This CFT provisions the following resources

    - Entire VPC Setup
    - EKS Cluster
    - EKS Cluster role --> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html
    - EKS Node role --> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html
    - EKS Cluster Security group
    - EKS Node Security group
    - EKS Nodegroup
    - ALB with dummy loadbalancer
    - A Public EC2 instance with required tools installed

3. Login to the EC2 instance created & Run below command
```
aws configure
```
--> Fill secret key and access key of your user (If you don't have them, create new access key and secret key)

Now, EC2 instance is setup with all tools required for EKS Advanced demo
