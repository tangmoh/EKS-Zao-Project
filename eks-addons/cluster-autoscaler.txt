The Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster when pods fail or are rescheduled onto other nodes. The Cluster Autoscaler is typically installed as a Deployment in your cluster. It uses leader election to ensure high availability, but scaling is done by only one replica at a time.

Prerequisites:

1. EKS Cluster up and running with atleast one node.

Cluster autoscaler installation:

1. Get into eks-cluster-autoscaler folder in infra folder

2. Get into terraform.tfvars file and update the below values

# Region and Profile Information
aws_region = "us-west-2"  # Update this value with AWS Region where your EKS Cluster is created
aws_profile = "joyoushire" # Update this value with the AWS Profile on your laptop

cluster_name = "eks-demo" # Update this value with the name of the EKS Cluster in which you want to install cluster autoscaler
cluster_identity_oidc_issuer = "oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/0DD941C460C6002A237F9E267AF11AD0" # Update this value with the OIDC issuer
cluster_identity_oidc_issuer_arn = "arn:aws:iam::464599248654:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/0DD941C460C6002A237F9E267AF11AD0" # Update this value with the OIDC issuer arn

3. Execute the following commands for the installation
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

4. After the successful installation, scale the existing deployments to see if the new EKS nodes are created.
